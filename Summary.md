# Victoria Kaloudis – Data Science Journey

Welcome! This repository highlights my progress and projects as I build my foundation in data science, combining my background in biochemistry and pharmaceutical strategy with technical skills in analytics and programming.

## Current Status
I completed the **Learn SQL Basics for Data Science** course through Coursera (offered by UC Davis). This course focused on writing queries to retrieve, filter, and analyze structured data—foundational skills for real-world evidence and healthcare analytics. I recently completed the **Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst (PL-300)** course through uCertify. This course prepared learners for the PL-300 certification exam by covering the end-to-end data analysis workflow in Microsoft Power BI.

## Upcoming Certifications
This is the first step in a structured learning path. I’ll continue expanding this repository as I work through:

- Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate
- IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
- SAS Data Science Certification

## About Me
With several years of experience in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry, I work closely with clinical and commercial data, CRM systems, and market strategy. I'm now focused on pivoting into more technical, data-centric roles within healthcare and life sciences.

## Planned Repo Structure
This repository will eventually include:
- `sql-practice/` – SQL challenges and learnings from StrataScratch, LeetCode, etc.
- `certification-notes/` – Summaries and key concepts from each certification
- `powerbi-dashboards/` – Screenshots and summaries of dashboard projects
- `healthcare-projects/` – Applied case studies using public datasets
