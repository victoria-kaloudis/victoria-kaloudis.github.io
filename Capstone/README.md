### Self Introduction
I’m excited to share my journey with you—a path that has been shaped by a passion for both science and technology. In 2017, I earned my B.S. in Biochemistry from Loyola University Chicago, drawn to the intricate science behind how things work. That passion led me into the biotechnology industry, where I supported pharmaceutical companies in the drug development process.

While working in the field, I began noticing opportunities to improve how we managed and visualized our data. This curiosity sparked my interest in computer science. I started experimenting with Microsoft Workflow, SharePoint rules, and Power BI dashboards to streamline our data operations. Through this hands-on experience, I discovered a new fascination: data science.

Determined to bridge my scientific background with emerging technologies, I made the decision to pursue a second degree in Computer Science—all while working full time. It’s been a challenging but incredibly rewarding experience, and I’m proud to be graduating in just a few weeks.

Combining biochemistry and computer science has opened the door to a fulfilling career in data science within the pharmaceutical space. I’m eager to continue learning, growing, and contributing to innovations at the intersection of science and technology.

### Professional Self-Assessment
Throughout my computer science program, I completed all coursework online while working full-time - a challenge that required dedication, time management, and perseverance. Balancing a demanding job with academic deadlines wasn’t easy. However, it allowed me to find passion in combining the current industry in which I am employed and the new industry (tech industry) I hope to join. The combination of projects and academic rigor helped me build technical skills and a clear professional identity, while also helping me find a new passion. It also gave me the confidence to pursue a career in data science within the pharmaceutical industry. 
One of the most meaningful parts of the program was working in team settings that reflected real-world software development. In classes like Software Engineering and Capstone, I collaborated with agile teams to design and build applications from the ground up. These experiences taught me how to divide responsibilities, work through disagreements, and contribute to code that fits into a larger project—skills that I know are essential in any software engineering job.
Another central growth area for me was communicating clearly with technical and non-technical audiences. Whether writing design plans, giving presentations, or participating in peer code reviews, I learned how to explain complex ideas in a way others could understand. 
Courses in data structures and algorithms helped sharpen my approach to problem-solving. I built custom data structures like hash maps and balanced trees and optimized code for performance. These lessons now guide me when debugging or working on system design challenges.
My software engineering and database classes also gave me a strong understanding of the whole development lifecycle. I learned how to use version control, write documentation, and integrate relational and NoSQL databases into projects. Managing deadlines and deliverables became second nature, and I realized how important it is to stay organized and accountable in fast-paced environments.
Cybersecurity courses improved my education by teaching me how to think about software from a risk and safety perspective. Topics like encryption, authentication, and threat modeling taught me how to build more secure, resilient systems—something that’s only becoming more important as technology continues to touch every part of our lives.
These experiences have shaped my thinking about teamwork, responsible development, and ongoing learning. They’ve helped me collaborate with internal teams at my current company to improve our IT management system, scientific databases, and sales databases. While combining my science and computer science knowledge, I know I can build meaningful, secure, and efficient technology and keep growing as a professional.

### Refinement Plan and Code Review
After reviewing the artifacts from my computer science program, I found that one project stood out above the rest. Early in the program, I was tasked with creating pseudocode for a pet company’s check-in and check-out process. That foundational assignment inspired me to take the project further by developing a mobile application using Android Studio. Having previously built an inventory app in Android Studio for another course—and thoroughly enjoying the experience—I saw an opportunity to merge that interest with the skills I had developed throughout the program. A quote by Steve Jobs resonated with me during this process: “The only way to do great work is to love what you do.” I genuinely enjoyed bringing this project to life. Combining my Java knowledge, software engineering principles, data structures and algorithms, and database management, I transformed the original pseudocode into a functional mobile app. This hands-on experience allowed me to apply classroom concepts meaningfully and significantly improve the original artifact. As graduation approaches, I look forward to continuing this project, refining its features, and exploring its full potential—turning an academic assignment into something tangible and impactful.

### Artifacts

The following artifacts represent my growth in the Computer Science program at SNHU. The artifacts demonstrate enhancements in Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.

#### Original Artifact
[Original Pseudocode IT-145 Artifact](Original_Artifact_Pseudocode.docx "Original Artifact Pseudocode")

This project involved designing the logic for a Pet Check-In method by first developing a detailed pseudocode to outline the workflow. I created a corresponding flowchart to represent the process based on that pseudocode visually. The flowchart serves as a communication tool for my team, helping us align on how we plan to develop the software for our client. It includes clearly defined start and end points, logical decision branches, and complete alignment with the original pseudocode, ensuring consistency and clarity throughout development.

#### Pet Hotel Application
[Capstone Project](Pet_Hotel_Android_Studio_Application.zip "Capstone Final Project")

To create an application that a pet hotel could utilize, I first conducted user interviews to understand what customers of the application would look for. I contacted some pet boarding services in my area and learned that they would like to have an employee registration database, a screen for available rooms regarding pets, and the ability to add more pet types and update existing pet types in case they expand. I have accomplished creating what these users want in the application.  

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="Images/Pet Hotel Artifact/Employee Registration Account.jpg" width="300px" title="Employee Registration Screenshot" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <img src="Images/Pet Hotel Artifact/Log In Screen.jpg" width="300px" title="Log In Screenshot" />
    <p><em>Figure 2 - Employee Registration and Log In Screen Screenshots</em></p>
</div>

When employees register, their information is stored in the employee database. Here, you can see the database that is created when I register as an employee of the pet hotel.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="Images/Pet Hotel Artifact/Databases.jpg" width="300px" title="Databases Screenshot" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <img src="Images/Pet Hotel Artifact/User Database.jpg" width="300px" title="User Databasae Screenshot" />
    <p><em>Figure 3 - Databases and User Database Screenshots</em></p>
</div>

After the employee logs into the application, they are directed to the home screen, where they can choose one of two options. The second option is not fully completed; it was just added to the screenshot to show the application's potential. The employee will choose Pet Space Availability and be directed to this screen.

<div style="text-align: center;">

#### Narrative
[Narrative](Narratives_of_Progress_Updates.docx "Narrative")

The narrative you will read is a combined document from my progress in enhancing the pseudocode. It should explain why I included the artifact in my ePortfolio and reflect on my process for creating it. The narrative focuses less on the actual creation of the artifact and more on the learning that happened through its creation. 

I chose this artifact for my capstone because it represents my growth throughout the computer science program. Created as pseudocode in an early course (IT-145), I expanded the concept into a fully functioning Android Studio mobile application. This allowed me to showcase how I’ve applied my skills in software design, engineering, algorithms, data structures, and user-centered design.

One of the significant challenges I faced was my limited experience with Android Studio, which led to persistent issues such as application crashes—especially when integrating multiple RecyclerViews and managing database functionality. Time constraints due to a demanding full-time job made troubleshooting and completing all intended features difficult. Despite these setbacks, I’ve continued refining the application, using user feedback, A/B testing, and design trade-offs to prioritize functionality over aesthetics. I remain committed to improving the app and eventually launching it for real-world use in pet boarding services.

While I’ve already achieved several milestones with this project, I see it as just the beginning. I plan to continue developing the application to support full functionality for pet boarders, enabling seamless Pet Check-In and Check-Out processes. I'm committed to refining and expanding the app as I complete my degree and transition into a new career phase. My ultimate goal is to launch it on the Android App Store, making it a valuable tool for pet hotels and boarding services to streamline their operations.
