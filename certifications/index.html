  <h1>Certifications</h1>

  <p>
    This page highlights my professional certifications and includes a narrative that reflects my growth throughout the computer science program. These experiences represent both my academic achievements and my commitment to expanding my technical expertise in data science and analytics.
  </p>

  <h2>Narrative</h2>
  <p><a href="Narrative_of_Certifications.docx">Download Certification Narrative</a></p>

  <p>
    The narrative you will read is a combined document from my progress in enhancing the pseudocode. It explains why I included the artifact in my ePortfolio and reflects on the process of creating and refining it. The narrative focuses less on the actual creation of the artifact and more on the learning that happened through its development.
  </p>

  <p>
    I chose this artifact for my capstone because it represents my growth throughout the computer science program. Created as pseudocode in an early course (IT-145), I expanded the concept into a fully functioning Android Studio mobile application. This allowed me to showcase how I’ve applied my skills in software design, engineering, algorithms, data structures, and user-centered design.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the significant challenges I faced was my limited experience with Android Studio, which led to persistent issues such as application crashes—especially when integrating multiple RecyclerViews and managing database functionality. Time constraints due to a demanding full-time job made troubleshooting and completing all intended features difficult. Despite these setbacks, I continued refining the application, using user feedback, A/B testing, and design trade-offs to prioritize functionality over aesthetics.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this process, I learned how to critically evaluate my own work, identify gaps in knowledge, and research solutions independently. I developed stronger debugging skills, became more confident in navigating complex development environments, and recognized the importance of iterative improvement. I also realized that user experience must remain central, even when technical barriers force compromises.
  </p>

  <p>
    Looking back, this artifact not only demonstrates my technical abilities but also highlights my persistence, adaptability, and commitment to continuous learning. The evolution from simple pseudocode to a dynamic mobile application symbolizes the progress I’ve made as both a student and an aspiring data scientist, preparing me for future challenges that require creative problem solving and resilience.
