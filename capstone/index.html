<h3 id="self-assessment">Professional Self-Assessment</h3>
<p>Throughout my computer science program, I completed all coursework online while working full-time - a challenge that required dedication, time management, and perseverance. Balancing a demanding job with academic deadlines wasn‚Äôt easy. However, it allowed me to find passion in combining the current industry in which I am employed and the new industry (tech industry) I hope to join. The combination of projects and academic rigor helped me build technical skills and a clear professional identity, while also helping me find a new passion. It also gave me the confidence to pursue a career in data science within the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>One of the most meaningful parts of the program was working in team settings that reflected real-world software development. In classes like Software Engineering and Capstone, I collaborated with agile teams to design and build applications from the ground up. These experiences taught me how to divide responsibilities, work through disagreements, and contribute to code that fits into a larger project‚Äîskills that I know are essential in any software engineering job.</p>
<p>Another central growth area for me was communicating clearly with technical and non-technical audiences. Whether writing design plans, giving presentations, or participating in peer code reviews, I learned how to explain complex ideas in a way others could understand.</p>

<h3 id="codereview">Refinement Plan and Code Review</h3>
<p>Early in the program, I was tasked with creating pseudocode for a pet company‚Äôs check-in and check-out process. That foundational assignment inspired me to take the project further by developing a mobile application using Android Studio. Having previously built an inventory app in Android Studio for another course‚Äîand thoroughly enjoying the experience‚ÄîI saw an opportunity to merge that interest with the skills I had developed throughout the program.</p>

<h4 id="narrative">Narrative</h4>
<p><a href="Narratives_of_Progress_Updates.docx">Download Narrative</a></p>

<p>The narrative you will read is a combined document from my progress in enhancing the pseudocode. It should explain why I included the artifact in my ePortfolio and reflect on my process for creating it. The narrative focuses less on the actual creation of the artifact and more on the learning that happened through its creation.</p>

<p>I chose this artifact for my capstone because it represents my growth throughout the computer science program. Created as pseudocode in an early course (IT-145), I expanded the concept into a fully functioning Android Studio mobile application. This allowed me to showcase how I‚Äôve applied my skills in software design, engineering, algorithms, data structures, and user-centered design.</p>

<p>One of the significant challenges I faced was my limited experience with Android Studio, which led to persistent issues such as application crashes‚Äîespecially when integrating multiple RecyclerViews and managing database functionality. Time constraints due to a demanding full-time job made troubleshooting and completing all intended features difficult. Despite these setbacks, I‚Äôve continued refining the application, using user feedback, A/B testing, and design trade-offs to prioritize functionality over aesthetics. I remain committed to improving the app and eventually launching it for real-world use in pet boarding services.</p>

<p>While I‚Äôve already achieved several milestones with this project, I see it as just the beginning. I plan to continue developing the application to support full functionality for pet boarders, enabling seamless Pet Check-In and Check-Out processes. I'm committed to refining and expanding the app as I complete my degree and transition into a new career phase. My ultimate goal is to launch it on the Android App Store, making it a valuable tool for pet hotels and boarding services to streamline their operations.</p>
