# Welcome to My Portfolio

I'm Victoria Kaloudis — a pharmaceutical professional pivoting into data science with a strong background in healthcare analytics, SQL, and Power BI. This site highlights my hands-on projects, certifications, and capstone experience.

I’m excited to share my journey with you—a path that has been shaped by a passion for both science and technology. In 2017, I earned my B.S. in Biochemistry from Loyola University Chicago, drawn to the intricate science behind how things work. That passion led me into the biotechnology industry, where I supported pharmaceutical companies in the drug development process.

While working in the field, I began noticing opportunities to improve how we managed and visualized our data. This curiosity sparked my interest in computer science. I started experimenting with Microsoft Workflow, SharePoint rules, and Power BI dashboards to streamline our data operations. Through this hands-on experience, I discovered a new fascination: data science.

Determined to bridge my scientific background with emerging technologies, I made the decision to pursue a second degree in Computer Science—all while working full time. It’s been a challenging but incredibly rewarding experience, and I’m proud to be graduating in just a few weeks.

Combining biochemistry and computer science has opened the door to a fulfilling career in data science within the pharmaceutical space. I’m eager to continue learning, growing, and contributing to innovations at the intersection of science and technology.
